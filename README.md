# macboot-toggle
Toggle the Mac boot chime

# How do I use it?
All you have to do is launch the app, then a window will pop up with two buttons: "Enable Chime" and "Disable Chime"

# What are the "classic" options?
If the normal buttons didn't work for you, try the classic ones, they are an older command that has been removed but it could work if you have an older release of macOS!
# When will it be ready?
I have no idea. Hopefully by April!
